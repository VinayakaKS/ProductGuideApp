In our busy day to day lives we often tend to neglect and overlook the ingredients used in a
product. There are many products in various categories like food products, cosmetics and
much more, many harmful chemicals are used hidden under coded format which is difficult
to understand for a layman. These harmful products are known to have various effects on the
human body on prolonged usage. Hence the proposed solution asks for a photo of the
ingredients section of the product and provides the user with the recommendation either to
buy (use) the product or not. The solution is implemented using an OCR engine to get the
text from scanned photos and a comparison script which is run in a backend server. The
frontend app is developed using flutter and dart. The list of harmful ingredients is
based in accordance with the Global entities like EU, WHO, JECFA.
